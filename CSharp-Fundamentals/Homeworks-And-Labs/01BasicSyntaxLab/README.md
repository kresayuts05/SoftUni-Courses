# 1.Student Information

You will be given 3 lines of input – student name, age and average grade. Your task is to print all the info about the student in the following format: &quot; **Name: {student name}, Age: {student age}, Grade: {student grade}**&quot;.

### Examples

| **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- |
| John | |
| 15 | |
|5.40 | Name: John, Age: 15, Grade: 5.40 |
| **Input** | **Output** |
| Steve | |
| 16 | |
| 2.50 | Name: Steve, Age: 16, Grade: 2.50 |
| **Input** | **Output** |
| Marry | |
| 12 | |
|6.00 | Name: Marry, Age: 12, Grade: 6.00 |

# 2.Passed

Write a program, which takes as an input a **grade** and prints &quot; **Passed!**&quot; if the grade is **equal or more than 3.00**.

### Input

The **input** comes as a single floating-point number.

### Output

The **output** is either &quot; **Passed!**&quot; if the grade is **equal or more than 3.00** , otherwise you should print nothing.

### Examples

| **Input** | **Output** |   | **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 5.32 | Passed! |   | 2.34 | _(no output)_ |

### Solution

We need to take as an input a floating-point number from the console. We will use **double.Parse()** to convert **string** to **double** , which we receive from **Console.ReadLine()**. After that we compare the grade with **3.00** and prints the result **only**** if **the condition returns** true**.



# 3.Passed or Failed

Modify the above program, so it will print &quot; **Failed**!&quot; if the grade is **lower than 3.00**.

### Input

The **input** comes as a single double number.

### Output

The **output** is either &quot; **Passed**!&quot; if the grade is **more than 2.99** , otherwise you should print &quot; **Failed**!&quot;.

### Examples

| **Input** | **Output** |   | **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 5.32 | Passed! |   | 2.36 | Failed! |

### Solution

Again, we need to take **floating-point** number from the console. After that print in the **else** statement the appropriate message.

# 4.Back in 30 Minutes

Every time Stamat tries to pay his bills he sees on the cash desk the sign: **&quot;**** I will be back in 30 minutes ****&quot;**. One day Stamat was sick of waiting and decided he needs a program, which **prints the time** after **30**** minutes**. That way he won&#39;t have to wait on the desk and come at the appropriate time. He gave the assignment to you, so you have to do it.

### Input

The **input** will be on two lines. On the **first**** line **, you will receive the** hours **and on the** second **you will receive the** minutes**.

### Output

Print on the console the time after **30** minutes. The result should be in format **hh:mm**. The **hours** have **one or two**** numbers **and the** minutes **have always** two numbers (with leading zero)**.

### Constraints

- **??** The **hours** will be between **0 and 23**.
- **??** The **minutes** will be between **0 and 59**.

### Examples

| **Input** | **Output** |   | **Input** | **Output** |   | **Input** | **Output** |   | **Input** | **Output** |   | **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1  | 2:16 |   | 0  | 0:31 |  | 23  | 0:29 |   | 11  | 11:38 |   | 11  | 12:02 |
| 46 |      |   |01  |      |  | 59  |      |   | 08  |       |   | 32  |       |
# 5.Month Printer

Write a program, which takes an **integer** from the console and prints the corresponding **month**. If the number **is more than 12** or **less than 1** print &quot; **Error!**&quot;.

### Input

You will receive a **single**** integer **on a** single line**.

### Output

If the number is within the boundaries print the corresponding month, otherwise print &quot; **Error!**&quot;.

### Examples

| **Input** | **Output** |   | **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2 | February |   | 13 | Error! |

### Solution

# 6.Foreign Languages

Write a program, which prints the language, that a given country speaks. You can receive only the following combinations: English **is spoken** in England and USA; Spanish **is spoken** in Spain, Argentina and Mexico; for the others **,** we should print &quot;unknown&quot;.

### Input

You will receive a **single country name** on a **single line**.

### Output

**Print** the **language** , which the country **speaks** , or if it is **unknown** for your program, print **&quot;**** unknown ****&quot;**.

### Examples

| **Input** | **Output** |   | **Input** | **Output** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| USA | English |   | Germany | unknown |

### Hint

Think how you can **merge** multiple cases, in order to **avoid** writing more code than you need to.

# 7.Theatre Promotions

A theatre **is doing a ticket sale** , but they need a program **to** calculate the price of a single ticket. If the given age does not fit one of the categories **,** you should print &quot;Error!&quot;.  You can see the prices i **n** the table below:

| **Day / Age** | **0 <= age <= 18** | **18 < age <= 64** | **64 < age <= 122** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Weekday** | 12$ | 18$ | 12$ |
| **Weekend** | 15$ | 20$ | 15$ |
| **Holiday** | 5$ | 12$ | 10$ |

### Input

The input comes in **two lines**. On the **first** line, you will receive the **type of day**. On the **second** – the **age** of the person.

### Output

Print the price of the ticket according to the table, or &quot; **Error!**&quot; if the age is not in the table.

### Constraints

- **??** The age will be in the interval **[-1000…1000]**.

| Weekday |   |Holiday|      |Holiday|     |Weekend|
|42 | 18$ |   | -12 | Error! | 15 | 5$ |   | 122 | 15$ |

# 8.Divisible by 3

### Input

On the first line, you will receive a number – **n**. This number shows how many **odd numbers** you should print.

### Output

Print the next **n** odd numbers, starting from **1** , separated by **new lines**. On the last line, print the **sum** of these numbers.
